#Multiline Comments
#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#ince Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a 
#multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
